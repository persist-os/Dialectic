we MUST use at least three sponsors

DEADLINE 4PM

Mission statement: 


build autonomous self. improving ai agents that can tap into real time data sources, make sense of what they find, and take meaningful action without human intervention. your challenge is to desighn agents that are not just reactive, but continulously learn and improve as they operate. creating solutions that feel alive, adaptive, and build for real world impact. 


Judging criteria. 

airia- in between layer. model library. prompt library. make custom prompts. tools section that allows easy connection. you can add your own. mcp servers exist in there. like google workspacce, github. also data sources like azure, s3, confluence. google drive.there is also a builder that allows input block, ai model block, output block. put in system prompt, tooling, and other options. agent to agent communication, code blocks in python. that's a quick overview. also have communicate with templates to kick start. community.airia.ai/templates 


ok lets be very real. these prizes are not in the high tier, and the better a project we make, the more we give away. lets not stress and focus on figuring out which technologies can actually be useful to us. airia's entire angle feels very done before. like salesforce will crush them angle. also they are very corporate and enterprise focused, which is not what we are going for. 

sentry. application monitoring software. optimize for end to end debuggability for applications...

maybe we should finally lean into the making a platform/tool for ourselves unlock the kind of self learning monitoring we do really need especially once we get proper a2a. this seems a lot more useful. this is our entry into dev tools. 

trace and debug agents with sentry. works with all major providers including litellm. mcp server for sentry allows access to issues and errors, search for errors ins epcific files, query projects and organizations, list and create sentry dns for projects
invoke seer to automatically fix isssues and get status and details of an issue fix.

@Web i wonder if there are ways we can set up self learning systems based on our existing .cursor folder. i have extensive documentation, rules, commands. i wonder if there is some way we could use the sponsors to make it come alive, instead of always having you go in and update it.  look if there is something that already exists like this, see how we can use the sponsors properly to make it elevatred. i think the point is that all of these docs, these extensive commands, the plans, they are all unique and a step beyond cursor's own setup. i wonder if we could also set up something that allows auto generation of this kind of system with less work and have it continuously maintain itself. i can see that being very good for ai coeding. 

but the problem with predeciding the sources is that it naturally introduces bias, so i wanted to set it up so another llm decides which agents are relevant for the appropriate query. or should we tie it into super enterprise and argue that the sources should just be decided by the company? tie it all together and tell me how this intended use case of airia differs from the original. how can we decide what to connect to? does airia make 

we MUST use at least three sponsors, but i wonder if we should widen our scope a bit. 


look at @HACKATHON_GUIDELINES.md and @hackathon_planning.mdc. how can we really get to the next level? take into consideration my specific notes about each sponsor. i think i do want to lean more towards making a dev tool we can use to improve our actual code because everything we build is very consumer focused. we did just build the convergence as per open source plans look up docs about convergence. we can honestly do pip install convergence but i do want to lean on using the sponsors. and we do have to build something new obviously. 


scale ai: b2b oriented. self assembling self updating agentic crm. designed for people about to start new companies that allow a context run crm to exist within 5 minutes. understand customers, build automations on top. sets up automatic data links, connects to gmail, calendar, slack. build in video recorder.

stack ai. insight: llms are powerful. ai toolkit for the enterprise. automate operations with ai works that can analyze data and take actions.

used for legal, defense, etc. orchestration platform to connect data sources with llms using different connectors. worflows, interfaces, integrations, on premise, security, support. 

red panda. 300 conenctors. streaming platform that simplifies building real time and ai applications. build and integration conenct -> transform -> stream -> explor. deploy and operatue automate. redpanda offering 100 dollars for new coming soon testing mcp servers. easy way to set up mcp. easiest to use redpanda is to consume data, like something from the stock market. you can also send your data from your agents to an analytics platform. 


we could also throw in fun roleplay esque scenarios like senior engineer reviewing junior engineer code/docs, a product manager chiming in, design  contributing their own docs. we can also take full advantage of how most of teh sponsors are obsessed with having a million tools and go really outside of just dev tool to a tool that allows full stack participation across the company OF the dev tools. just like how i want rob and sandra to write design guidelines, we can pull in diverse voices to elevate the ideas, the focuses, everything about the code that goes beyond just code. we can bass boost elevate user experience, link directly to github and other tools, there is so much we can do. theres a lot we can focus on, but one of the most critical things.

ALL OF THESE COMPANIES DO THE EXACT SAME THING

i dont want use apify because they are just money sucking convenience to get you through the door and locked in. 

senso using context os to transform raw context into self improving ai agents. inject structured of unconstructed content. configure agent prompts and templates to guide behavior. convert that data into executable context for downstreak tasks. 

according to them, imprvoing the context window is how to make self improving agents. 

2k in credits. docs.senso.ai, they have mcp server to inject markdown, search, generate, templates, prompts. a playground for context windows. 

i think it will be very interesting if we can reduce anything hardcoded. i dont even want to define what each agent does, i want to set up a system where the agents themselves, the roles they play, they are all dynamic and part of the self improvement itself. if the codebase calls for a focus on secuirty, there should absolutely be a more hardcore security agent. but if the priority is mvp or hackathon that really just needs to work, the opinions we need are entirely different. i want to make sure we can adapt to that. the goal is ultimate comapbability and the less we hardcode, the more legitimacy it adds. i think one good thing would be to maybe set it up as an mcp server or background tool in some way that reacts to all of the possible events like commits or a new chat starting,. but we do have only a few hours so dont go crazy. i think the hackathon does want non human intervention systems, so the primary selling point i think is that its editing the documentation and rules and commands and accelerating the workflow that way rather than touching code, so even the models can be lower quality and cheaper, and mistakes are much less high risk than
